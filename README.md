# Preface

The purpose of the present work is to formulate sound theological or philosophical arguments around practical problems that one is likely to face in his experience of life. In so formulating the contributors hope to gain insight into these problems and retain the solutions by virtue of the familiarity one has with his own work. This familiarity of insights and arguments will be invaluable for readily bringing coherent truth to bear in impromptu philosophical discussion.

The form of the disputation is perfectly suited to fulfill these purposes. The organization of the disputation clearly formulates the problem, objections, relevant authority, argument, and replies to the objections. Furthermore, insofar as they already resemble notes for an expanded verbal discussion they aim directly at a key purpose for this work. 

An effort to translate these disputations into Latin will be undertaken for two reasons: clarity and Latin proficiency. Translating sentences into a different language, especially a grammatically precise inflected language, always contributes towards revealing ambiguities and vague words as well as forcing grammatical precision into the foreground. In this way, the Latin text will serve to improve the English text. The second purpose is to reinforce the Latin skills of the contributors through the repeated translation of practical sentences that use practical vocabulary and grammar. It will be noticed that both purposes primarily serve the contributors and not hypothetical readers; but this is acknowledged to be true of the whole project. 

As life follows no plan that is known from the outset, so will this work take up lived issues in no particular order. 

I would make acknowledgements, but that would be tedious and even more pretentious than the rest of this preface. However I will take the opportunity to link an invaluable Latin lexicon tool: https://latinlexicon.org/.
